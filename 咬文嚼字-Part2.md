**Bang for the buck** is an [idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom) meaning the worth of one's money or exertion. The phrase originated from the slang usage of the words "bang" which means "excitement" and "buck" which means "money".[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_for_the_buck#cite_note-Heacock19-1) Variations of the term include "bang for **your** buck," "bang for **one's** buck," "**more** bang for the buck," "**bigger** bang for the buck," and mixings of these. "More bang for the buck" was preceded by "more bounce to the ounce", an advertising slogan used in 1950 to market the carbonated soft drink [Pepsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi).

The phrase "bigger bang for the buck" was notably used by U.S. President [Dwight D. Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower)'s [Secretary of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State), [Charles Erwin Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Erwin_Wilson), in 1954. He used it to describe the [New Look](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Look_(policy)) policy of depending on nuclear weapons, rather than a large regular army, to keep the Soviet Union in check. Today, the phrase is used to mean a greater worth for the money used.

!4$ is sometimes used as a shorthand version.



### buck = dollar

The "buck" is a holdover from America's colonial frontier days when buckskins were the primary measure for bartering goods. The earliest evidence we have of this tradition comes from the journals of [Conrad Weiser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conrad_Weiser), who in 1748, while writing about a trade dispute, [recalled](https://archive.org/stream/con00radweisersjouweisrich/con00radweisersjouweisrich_djvu.txt):

> Your Brethren, therefore, have order'd that every cask of Whiskey shall be sold to You for five Bucks in your Town
> The term appears to have stuck around after the dollar became the benchmark for trade after its introduction (and with greater success than the derided Continental).

The first time "a grand" was used in relation to money, however, did not happen until the turn of the last century. The first recorded reference for the use of "a grand" as slang for $1,000 is in 1915, although the Oxford English Dictionary doesn't give it a first citation until 1921, the date of its appearance in [Collier's](https://colliersmagazine.com/). It doesn't appear to have any other meaning than "a grand sum of money."

Tangential Trivia: \$1,000 in 1915 would be the equivalent of \$23,500 today.

 ## -wise

### Otherwise

一个单词有很多个意思，但都来自一个本质意思，你只要充分理解这个本质意思，所有的意思都一通百通。

**otherwise**的本质意思就是 ***not this one, but something else***，很明显就是从**other**衍生过来的，其后缀**`wise`**是表示**「in a… way」**以…方式，**「in … respect」**在…方面。

比如

- likewise 类似的（in a "like" way）
- clockwise 顺时针的 （沿着钟表走动的方向）
- stepwise 逐步的 （像阶梯一样的方式）

你自己也可以用wise创造新词，这种做法很常见，表示「在…方面」

- timewise 在时间方面(Timewise, we are OK 在时间方面，我们还很充足）
- moneywise 在钱方面
- marketwise 在市场方面
- healthwise 在健康方面

我们再来看otherwise，就是在其他方面(other respect/other thing），即not this one but something else，就是指「除目前说的这个以外的其他…」，something else包罗万象，指代任何你想指代的东西。

> 否则（if not）只是其中的一个意思，出现在是两个对立的情况中，只有Yes和No，才会让你觉得otherwise是「否则」的意思。

如果在非对立的情况中，**otherwise就是指除此之外的「其他情况」**。

反正这是个万能词，可以指代任何方面，既可以是副词，也可以是代词。比如:

- Please follow my instructions. Don't do it ***otherwise**(副词，= don’t do it in a different way).*

## orthogonal

Authorization is [orthogonal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction?view=aspnetcore-5.0) and independent from authentication. However, authorization requires an authentication mechanism.  

Used to describe two things that are independent of each other. One does not imply the other.
> Common sense and intelligence are orthogonal. I've seen plenty of smart people with no common sense.
