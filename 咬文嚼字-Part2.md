 ## -wise

### Otherwise

一个单词有很多个意思，但都来自一个本质意思，你只要充分理解这个本质意思，所有的意思都一通百通。

**otherwise**的本质意思就是 ***not this one, but something else***，很明显就是从**other**衍生过来的，其后缀**`wise`**是表示**「in a… way」**以…方式，**「in … respect」**在…方面。

比如

- likewise 类似的（in a "like" way）
- clockwise 顺时针的 （沿着钟表走动的方向）
- stepwise 逐步的 （像阶梯一样的方式）

你自己也可以用wise创造新词，这种做法很常见，表示「在…方面」

- timewise 在时间方面(Timewise, we are OK 在时间方面，我们还很充足）
- moneywise 在钱方面
- marketwise 在市场方面
- healthwise 在健康方面

我们再来看otherwise，就是在其他方面(other respect/other thing），即not this one but something else，就是指「除目前说的这个以外的其他…」，something else包罗万象，指代任何你想指代的东西。

> 否则（if not）只是其中的一个意思，出现在是两个对立的情况中，只有Yes和No，才会让你觉得otherwise是「否则」的意思。

如果在非对立的情况中，**otherwise就是指除此之外的「其他情况」**。

反正这是个万能词，可以指代任何方面，既可以是副词，也可以是代词。比如:

- Please follow my instructions. Don't do it ***otherwise**(副词，= don’t do it in a different way).*

## orthogonal

Authorization is [orthogonal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/introduction?view=aspnetcore-5.0) and independent from authentication. However, authorization requires an authentication mechanism.  

Used to describe two things that are independent of each other. One does not imply the other.
> Common sense and intelligence are orthogonal. I've seen plenty of smart people with no common sense.
